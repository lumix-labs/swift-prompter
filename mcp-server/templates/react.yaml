  To solve this problem, I'll use a reasoning and action approach:
  
  1. I'll think through what we need to solve the problem
  2. For each step, I'll reason about what to do
  3. I'll take specific actions to gather information
  4. I'll observe the results
  5. I'll continue with this process until I reach the final answer
  
  Let's begin:
